            Find Your Anchor is a nonprofit organization aimed to help individuals impacted by suicide. The “Find Your
            Anchor” website currently does not display their box as the main focus within their content. With a website
            redesign, we can bring attention to the Anchor Box and expand its reach to individuals in need.<br /><br />This
            project is aiming to redesign the website for Find Your Anchor. We hope to integrate the organization’s vision
            and mission into its website design so that it is immediately clear to users. We will make the site more
            easily navigable so that users can send and receive boxes.<br/><br />UX Designer on a team of 3 was to
            perform research using competive analysis, compose a Story Board, attempt to contact the Stakeholder to better
            understand pain points they are seeing and learn about their goals to create card sorting. The cards were
            attained from 25 people in a survey and 2 phone interviews. Using the information collected I was able to
            scope the project to fit within the time constraints. Creating wireframes for user testing Find Your Anchor.

              to be convinced.<br /><br />We grouped users’ answers and survey answers onto sticky notes. We grouped them

              that there was a way to share or reach out on a website to get something quick. Though we wanted to feature
              the box, we wondered if adding a chat or social media links would solve the pains of the user aside from the
              knowledge of the box.</span

              >My team wanted to validate the vision we had in reorganizing information the original user flow had. My
              role was to generate sketches for desktop. At the beginning of my design process, I created the low fidelity
              pencil on paper sketches which provide a way to show concepts for app functionality and preliminary design
              elements.<br /><br />I discussed with my team as we shared our sketches for mobile to compare. We talked out
              what is working and what could be better for the next stage in compiling our sketches for mid-fidelity.
              Figma was used to produce one mid and high fidelity for mobile and desktop for user testing. The challenge
              was deciding whether to keep the forms for getting or receiving a box and donating on a pop-up or on a one
              page. We knew eliminating the 19 questions survey for the user to go through before being asked what the
              user would like to do would be a good idea in order to retain the user on the Find Your Anchor website to
              complete the tasks. To not eliminate the survey in total, we added it after the user submits the form and
              keeping it as an option.</span

              were able to keep them on the page as they read through why you wouldn’t have to donate if the box is for
              yourself vs why you have the opportunity to donate if you’re attaining the box for someone else.<br />From
              reading their behavioral reaction to the prototype for web and mobile, we saw that they were engaged with
              the homepage and became aware of what this organization is about. Though narrating their actions to us, the
              user would show a reaction of scanning through the entire page looking for an image or some context of what
              each section on a form was for before proceeding. We noticed that on the homepage, the chat button needed to
              standout more, but when found, the user liked that you could reach out to ask questions for a site providing
              resources for a health issue rather than search for the answer throughout the website. While we assumed that
              staying with a palette of blue and white throughout the website would be easy on the eyes for the user in
              making them feel calm, we learned that adding an opposite color from the color wheel would be a great
              addition to making the chat or hover over the navigation pull more visual interest to the user.</span

            click throughs. We learned that people will drop out if asked to do too many tasks or get confused when the

              unsure where to begin. Didn’t find a box but came across the website first? What is this box and what is
              Find Your Anchor? My team was ready to help this organization have finding the box and coming to the website
